** Overview

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The goal of Semantic UI is to narrow the divide between how we create meaning
personally, through language, and how we construct meaning for computers.

[[https://semantic-ui.com][Semantic-UI]] is a UI component framework based around useful principles from
natural language. As its motto said, "User interface is the language of the
web." It allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with *concise
HTML*, *intuitive JavaScript*, and *simplified debugging*, helping
make front-end development a delightful experience.

Key features of Semantic-UI:
- 50+ UI elements
- 3000 + CSS variables
- 3 Levels of variable inheritance (similar to Sublime Text)
- Built with EM values for responsive design
- Flexbox friendly


*** Compared with Bootstrap?

Now it's the time to ask that very important question --- of course I know that
you will finally shout it out loud --- "Tell me, what's the difference between
[[https://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]] and Semantic-UI?" Aha, this is a huge question. Actually, Semantic-UI
has already show us an official [[http://learnsemantic.com/preface/whats-different.html][answer]].

Bootstrap has a much much more mature ecosystem than Semantic-UI --- it has tons
of free and commercial templates and themes, while Semantic-UI has few --- and
that's why we spent several hundreds of hours building this website for you,
smart fellow developers.

Besides, in our own experience, we feel more delightful when developing with
Semantic-UI. Maybe code speaks more than words:

*** Grid

Semantic-UI:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<main class="ui three column grid">
  <aside class="column">1</aside>
  <section class="column">2</section>
  <section class="column">3</section>
</main>
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <div class="ui horizontal divider">VS</div>

Bootstrap:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-4">1</div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">2</div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">3</div>
</div>
#+END_SRC

*** Menu

Semantic-UI:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<nav class="ui menu">
  <h3 class="header item">Title</h3>
  <a class="active item">Home</a>
  <a class="item">Link</a>
  <a class="item">Link</a>
  <span class="right floated text item">
    Signed in as <a href="#">user</a>
  </span>
</nav>
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <div class="ui horizontal divider">VS</div>

Bootstrap:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div class="navbar">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Title</a>
  <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
    <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    <p class="navbar-text pull-right">Signed in as <a href="#" class="navbar-link">User</a></p>
  </ul>
</div>
#+END_SRC

*** Button

Semantic UI:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<button class="ui large button">
  <i class="heart icon"></i>
  Like it
</button>
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <div class="ui horizontal divider">VS</div>

Bootstrap:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span>
  Like
</button>
#+END_SRC

** Semantic-UI-Forest

Semantic-UI-Forest provides collection of design, themes and templates for
Semantic-UI.

Years ago, when I first met Semantic-UI, I suddenly fall in love with it, made
several websites with it. I have to say that it's quite a delightful experience.
And soon Semantic-UI becames my favourite frontend CSS framework.

As we said before, compared with Bootstrap, the ecosystem of Semantic-UI is
small, so we decided to make some contributions, and then Semantic-UI-Forest was
born. With several hundreds hours of work, it grew up to present with 22
well-tested templates and 24 beautiful themes --- and yes, it's all free,
released under BSD 3-clause license.

*** Themes

We have ported all 16 themes on famous [[https://bootswatch.com/][Bootswatch]], from Bootstrap to
Semantic-UI, so you can use these most popular themes along with Semantic-UI
right now. [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/bootswatch/cerulean/][Cerulean]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/bootswatch/cyborg/][Cyborg]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/bootswatch/journal/][Journal]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/bootswatch/superhero/][Superhero]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/bootswatch/united/][United]], etc., all these
gorgeous themes are available for Semantic-UI. We've also prebuilt some
Semantic-UI's bundled theme for you, such as [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/semantic-ui/amazon/][Amazon]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/semantic-ui/github/][Github]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/semantic-ui/material/][Material]], [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/themes/semantic-ui/twitter/][Twitter]],
etc.

It's also ultra easy to apply themes. You could just click the ~Download~
button, and replace the original ~semantic.min.css~ with the CSS files of the
theme you've downloaded, that's it. With a new theme, your site would become
unique, fresh and more impressive! Check it out by yourself:

*** Templates

For those looking for templates to start a prototype quickly, we've also ported
all official Bootstrap [[https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples][examples]] to Semantic-UI. Popular layouts such as [[http://semantic-ui-forest.com/templates/bootstrap/blog/][blog]],

application right now. Of course, you can easily customize them with handy
Semantic-UI classes at your will. Hit now:
